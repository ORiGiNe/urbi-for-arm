Notes from Guillaume Deslandes.

Notes:
- timeout (4) loop| ;
  -> timeout not honored
  -> ',' not honored either

- class a { ... sleep ()  .... };
  -> isdef (a): 1, but a == Void
  -> missing some "isinit" ?

- Stop some detached code ? if not tagged ?
- stopall works only on "my" code. Way to stop everything ?
- page 56, 8.3, and a colon ($:$) -> ":"
- Add come "clean" method on tags: stop, unfreeze, unblock
- Table 14.1: "bitand Synonym for & operator" ???

- CallMessage.args ?

Questions:
- diff .asString and .asPrintable ?
- listing 3.19: way to write into a via b ?
- Mutex via tags ?
- Switch current task ?
- Fix style ?
  unfreeze -> unFreeze
  ...
- No doc for pattern matching in switch

- new -> clone ; try (init ()) catch (...) raise (...)
- allow to raise Urbi exceptions from binded C++
- CTRL-C in a telnet connection: stops UObjects' updates (created in this connection)
  but does not delete UObjects

Check:
- redefine '=' for an object ?
- Need Float.srand ? Done automagically ?
