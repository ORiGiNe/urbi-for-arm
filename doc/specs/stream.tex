\section{Stream}

This is used to factor code between \refObject{InputStream} and
\refObject{OutputStream}.

\subsection{Prototypes}
\begin{refObjects}
\item[Object]
\end{refObjects}

\subsection{Construction}
\label{sec:specs:Stream:ctor}

Streams are not meant to be built, rather, use \refObject{InputStream} or
\refObject{OutputStream}.

When a stream (\refObject{OutputStream} or \refObject{InputStream}) is
opened on a File, that File cannot be removed.  On Unix systems, this is
handled gracefully (the references to the file are removed, but the content
is still there for the streams that were already bound to this file); so in
practice, the File appears to be removable.  On Windows, the File cannot be
removed at all.  Therefore, do not forget to close the streams you opened.

\subsection{Slots}

\begin{urbiscriptapi}
\item[close] Flush the buffers, close the stream, return void.  Raise an
  error if the file is closed.
\begin{urbiscript}
{
  var i = InputStream.new(File.create("file.txt"));
  assert(i.close.isVoid);
  i.close;
};
[00000001:error] !!! close: stream is closed

{
  var o = OutputStream.new(File.create("file.txt"));
  assert(o.close.isVoid);
  o.close;
};
[00000002:error] !!! close: stream is closed
\end{urbiscript}
\end{urbiscriptapi}
