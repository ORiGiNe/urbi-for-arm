This directory contains images used to tests Urbi's support for
images.

* jpeg
This series of jpg images provide a "fake camera" support (as
camera.val).

* sources
This is jpeg/00.jpg converted to various formats.

* converted
These are the images from sources/ converted to the different formats
we support.  This is used for instance by the test suite to make sure
there are no regressions in image conversion routines.
