\chapter{Urbi for ROS Users}
\setHtmlFileName{ros-tutorial}
\label{sec:tut:ros}


This chapter extends the \rosref[Tutorials]{ROS official tutorials}.  Be
sure to complete this tutorial before reading this document.

\section{Communication on topics}

First we will take back examples about topics; make sure that talker and
listener in the \file{beginner\_tutorial} package are compiled. You can
recompile it with the following command:

\begin{shell}
$ rosmake beginner_tutorial
\end{shell}

\subsection{Starting a process from \urbi}

To communicate with ROS components, you need to launch them. You can do it
by hand, or ask \urbi to do it for you. To launch new processes through
\urbi, we will use the class \refObject{Process}.

Let's say we want to start \command{roscore}, and the talker of the beginner
tutorial.  Open an \urbi shell by typing the command \samp{rlwrap urbi
  -i}.  Here \command{rlwrap} makes \samp{urbi -i} acts like a shell prompt,
with features like line editing, history, \ldots

\begin{urbiunchecked}
var core = Process.new("roscore", []);
[00000001] Process roscore
var talker = Process.new("rosrun", ["beginner_tutorial", "talker"]);
[00000002] Process rosrun
core.run;
talker.run;
\end{urbiunchecked}

At this point, the processes are launched. The first argument of
\lstinline{Process.new} is the name of the command to launch, the second is
a list of arguments.

Then you can check the status of the processes, get their stdout/stderr
buffers, kill them in \us (see \refObject{Process}).


\subsection{Listening to Topics}

First you need to make sure that \command{roscore} is running, and the ROS
module is loaded correctly:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
Global.hasLocalSlot("Ros");
[00016931] true
\end{urbiunchecked}

\noindent
Then we can get the list of launched nodes:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
Ros.nodes;
\end{urbiunchecked}

This returns a \refObject{Dictionary} with the name of the node as key, and
a dictionary with topics subscribed, topics advertised, topics advertised as
value.

We can check that our talker is registered, and on which channel it
advertises:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
// Get the structure.
// "|;" is an idiom to discard the display of the return value.
var nodes = Ros.nodes|;

// List of nodes (keys).
nodes.keys;
[00000002] ["/rosout", "/urbi_1273060422295250703", "/talker"]

// Details of the node "talker".
nodes["talker"]["publish"];
[00000003] ["/rosout", "/chatter"]
\end{urbiunchecked}

Here we see that this node advertises \file{/rosout} and
\file{/chatter}. Let's subscribe to \file{/chatter}:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
// Initialize the subscription object.
var chatter = Ros.Topic.new("/chatter")|;
// Subscribe.
chatter.subscribe;
// This is the way we are called on new message.
var chatTag = Tag.new|;
chatTag: at (chatter.onMessage?(var e))
  // This will be executed on each message.
  echo(e);
\end{urbiunchecked}

In this code, \lstinline{e} is a Dictionary that follows the structure of
the ROS message. Here is an example of what this code produces:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
[00000004] *** ["data" => "Hello there! This is message [4]"]
[00000005] *** ["data" => "Hello there! This is message [5]"]
[00000006] *** ["data" => "Hello there! This is message [6]"]
\end{urbiunchecked}

We can also get a template for the message structure on this channel with:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
chatter.structure;
[00000007] ["data" => ""]
\end{urbiunchecked}

To stop temporarily the \refSlot[Global]{echo}, we take advantages of tags
(\autoref{sec:tut:tags}), by doing \lstinline{chatTag.freeze}.  Same thing
goes with unfreeze.  Of course you could also call
\lstinline{chatter.unsubscribe}, which unsubscribes you completely from this
channel.


\subsection{Advertising on Topics}

To advertise a topic, this is roughly the same procedure.


\subsubsection{Simple Talker}

Here is a quick example:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
// Initialize our object.
var talker = Ros.Topic.new("/chatter")|;
// Advertise (providing the ROS Type of this topic).
talker.advertise("std_msgs/String");

// Get a template of our structure.
var msg = talker.structure.new;
msg["data"] = "Hello ROS world"|;
talker << msg;
\end{urbiunchecked}

We have just sent our first message to ROS, here if you launch the chatter,
you will be able to get the message we have just sent.

The \lstinline{<<} operator is an convenient alias for
\refSlot[Ros.Topic]{publish}.



\subsubsection{Turtle Simulation}
\label{sec:turtlesim}

Now we are going to move the turtle with \urbi. First let's launch the
turtle node:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
var turtle = Process.new("rosrun", ["turtlesim", "turtlesim_node"])|;
turtle.run;
\end{urbiunchecked}

\refSlot[Ros]{topics} shows that this turtle subscribes to a topic
\file{/turtle1/command\_velocity}. Let's advertise on it:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
var velocity = Ros.Topic.new("/turtle1/command_velocity")|;
velocity.advertise("turtlesim/Velocity");
velocity.structure;
[00000001] ["linear" => 0, "angular" => 0]
\end{urbiunchecked}


Now we want to have it moving in circle with a small sinusoid wave.  This
goes in two step.  First, we set up the infrastructure so that changes in
\urbi are seamlessly published in ROS.

\begin{urbiunchecked}
// Get our template structure.
var m = velocity.structure.new |;
m["linear"] = 0.8 |;
var angular = 0 |;
// Every time angular is changed, we send a message.
at (angular->changed?)
{
  m["angular"] = angular;
  velocity << m
};
\end{urbiunchecked}

\noindent
In the future \urbi will provide helping functions to spare the user from
the need to perform this ``binding''.  But once this binding done, all the
features of \us can be used transparently.

\begin{multicols}{2}
  For instance we can assign a sinusoidal trajectory to \samp{angular},
  which results in the screen-shot on the right-hand side.

\begin{urbiunchecked}[xrightmargin=0cm,xleftmargin=0cm]
// For 20 seconds, bind "angular" to a sine.
timeout (20s)
  angular = 0.3 sin: 2s ampli: 2;
\end{urbiunchecked}

Every time \lstinline{angular} is changed, a new message is sent on the
Topic \file{/turtle1/command\_velocity}, thus updating the position of the
turtle.  After 20 seconds the command is stopped.

\columnbreak

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{img/turtlesim-tutorial}
\end{center}

\end{multicols}

\bigskip

Alternatively, \refObject[Tag]{Tags} could have been used to get more
control over the trajectory:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
// A Tag to control the following endless statement.
var angTag = Tag.new|;

angTag:
  // Bind "angular" to a trajectory.
  // Put in background thanks to ",", since this statement is never ending.
  angular = 0.3 sin: 2s ampli: 2,

// Leave 20 seconds to the turtle...
sleep(20s);

// before freezing it.
angTag.freeze;
\end{urbiunchecked}

We won't cover this code in details, but the general principle is that
\lstinline{angular} is updated every 20ms with the values of a sinusoid wave
trajectory with 0.3 as average value, 2 seconds for the period and 2 for the
amplitude.  See \refObject{TrajectoryGenerator} for more information.  After
20 seconds the tag is frozen, pausing the trajectory generation and the
\lstinline{at}.



\section{Using Services}

Services work the same way topics do, with minor differences.

Let's take back the turtle simulation example (\autoref{sec:turtlesim}).
Then we can list the available services, and filter out loggers:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
var logger = Regexp.new("(get|set)_logger") |;
var services = Ros.services.keys |;
for (var s in services)
  if (s not in logger)
    echo(s);
[00000001] *** "/clear"
[00000001] *** "/kill"
[00000001] *** "/turtle1/teleport_absolute"
[00000001] *** "/turtle1/teleport_relative"
[00000001] *** "/turtle1/set_pen"
[00000001] *** "/reset"
[00000001] *** "/spawn"
\end{urbiunchecked}

The \lstinline{closure} construct allows us to keep access to the local
variables, here \lstinline{logger}.

Now there is a service called \file{/spawn}; to initialize it:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
var spawn = Ros.Service.new("/spawn", false) |;
waituntil(spawn.initialized);
\end{urbiunchecked}

The \lstinline{new} function takes the service name as first argument, and
as second argument whether the connection should be kept alive.

Since the creation of this object checks the service name, you should wait
until \lstinline{initialized} is true to use this service.  You can also see
the structure of the request with \lstinline{spawn.reqStruct}, and the
structure of the response with \lstinline{spawn.resStruct}.

Now let's spawn a turtle called Jenny, at position (4, 4).

\begin{urbiunchecked}
var req = spawn.reqStruct.new |;
req["x"] = 4 |
req["y"] = 4 |
req["name"] = "Jenny" |;
spawn.request(req);
[00000001] ["name" => "Jenny"]
\end{urbiunchecked}

\section{Image Publisher from ROS to \urbi}

This section will use topics manipulation with advertising and subscription.
Be sure to understand these topics before doing this tutorial.

\paragraph{Requirements}

You have to finish the image Publisher/Subscriber tutorial
(\url{http://www.ros.org/wiki/image_transport/Tutorials}) before doing this
tutorial.

First, we will make a ROS Publisher and subscribe to it with \urbi.  Make
sure that Publisher \samp{learning\_image\_transport} package is compiled:

\begin{shell}
$ rosmake learning_image_transport
\end{shell}

We will also run \command{urbi} with a network connection opened (e.g., on
port 54000) to allow \command{urbi-image} (\autoref{sec:tools:urbi-image})
to connect to it.

\begin{shell}
$ urbi --host=127.0.0.1 --port=54000 -- -f
\end{shell}

Also, you have to run \command{roscore} to communicate with ROS.

\begin{urbiunchecked}
var core = Process.new("roscore", []);
[00000001] Process roscore
core.run;
\end{urbiunchecked}


\paragraph{Run the Publisher}
The Publisher is a process that will send a image and wait for a Subscriber
to get it.

\begin{urbiunchecked}
// In this example the image is in the current directory.
var publisher =
  Process.new("rosrun",
              ["learning_image_transport", "my_publisher", "test.jpg"]);
[0000002] Process rosrun
publisher.run;
\end{urbiunchecked}

\paragraph{Using a camera to display}
By default, \command{urbi-image} displays the images that are available via
the \lstinline{camera} device (see \autoref{sec:tools:urbi-image}).  To
simplify the setup, let's define a pseudo \lstinline{camera} which will
store the data received:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
class Global.camera: Loadable
{
  // A variable to store image data.
  UVar.new(this, "val");
  val = 0;
}|;
\end{urbiunchecked}


\paragraph{Subscribe to the topic}
Now, our Publisher is running and we have a camera waiting for data.  All we
need to do is connecting to the Publisher with a topic, the Subscriber.

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/ros-image-publisher}
  \caption{Output from \command{rxgraph}}
  \label{fig:ros:img-pub}
\end{figure}

Have a look at the different topics created by the Publisher, for instance
by running \command{rxgraph}, which generates the graph in
\autoref{fig:ros:img-pub}.  As you can see, seven topics are available for
the camera. We will use the \file{/camera/image/compressed} topic for this
example.  For further information about the image format in ROS see
\url{http://www.ros.org/doc/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/CompressedImage.html}.

\begin{urbiunchecked}
var cameraTopic = Ros.Topic.new("/camera/image/compressed")|;
at (cameraTopic.onMessage?(var imgMsg))
{
  // Converting the ROS image to Urbi format.
  imgMsg["data"].keywords = imgMsg["format"]|
  // We can now store the data into camera.
  if (!camera.val)
    echo("Image well received. Store the image into the camera") |
  camera.val = imgMsg["data"];
},
// Waiting for the "publisher" Process to be set up.
sleep(2s);
cameraTopic.subscribe;
\end{urbiunchecked}

We are now connected and ready to display.

\begin{urbiunchecked}
[00000003] *** Image well received. Store the image into the camera
\end{urbiunchecked}

In a new terminal run \command{urbi-image}:

\begin{shell}
$ urbi-image
Monitor created window 62914561
***Frame rate: 5.000000 fps***
\end{shell}

You have now your image displayed in a window.

\section{Image Subscriber from \urbi to ROS}

Now, we want to send images to ROS using a \urbi Publisher.
Make sure \command{roscore} is running and
\samp{learning\_image\_transport} package is compiled.

\paragraph{Run the Subscriber}

The basic Subscriber in the \samp{learning\_image\_transport} package
is expecting a \file{/camera/image} topic. To avoid modifying the
Subscriber code in ROS, we will simply ask to the Subscriber topic
to accept \file{/camera/image/compressed} topics.

\begin{urbiunchecked}
var subscriber =
  Process.new("rosrun",
              ["learning_image_transport", "my_subscriber",
              "_image_transport:=compressed"]);
[00037651] Process rosrun
subscriber.run;
\end{urbiunchecked}

\paragraph{Publishing images with \urbi}

The \file{sensor\_msgs/CompressedImage} message format provides a
structure that requires a few changes.

\begin{urbiunchecked}
// File.new("...").content returns a Binary.
var urbiImage = File.new("test.jpg").content|;
urbiImage.keywords = "jpeg"|;

var publisher = Ros.Topic.new("/camera/image/compressed")|;
// Advertising the type of message used.
publisher.advertise("sensor_msgs/CompressedImage");

var rosImg = publisher.structure.new|;
// The rosImg is a dictionary containing a Binary and a String.
rosImg["data"] = urbiImage|;
rosImg["format"] = "jpeg"|;
\end{urbiunchecked}

This message contains more fields but you need only these two to
send an image.

Now, you just have to publish the image.

\begin{urbiunchecked}
// Publishing at regular intervals.
every (500ms)
{
  publisher << img;
},
\end{urbiunchecked}

Communication is done, the image should be displayed.

\section{Remote communication}

We have worked with a \command{roscore} running on the machine as the ROS
processes but the purpose of using ROS with \urbi is to communicate with a
remote machine.  All you need is to setup your network configuration to
avoid unexpected behaviors (see \rosref{NetworkSetup}).

Make sure the ROS environment variables are well set, especially
\env{ROS\_URI}, \env{ROS\_HOSTNAME}, \env{ROS\_IP}.

See \rosref{Tutorials/MultipleMachines} for additional information.

Try our tutorials remotely to check if the connection is set correctly.
